			<p class='p2'>Dear Parents, Guardians and DAV School Community,<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the DAV School website.  As the Principal of DAV School I am very fortunate to work with many dedicated, innovative and caring staff members, parents and students.  Each day is filled with new experiences, learning for all, and the ability to make someones day better many days it is the students who make my day a little brighter.<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DAV School curriculum and practices are consistently reviewed to ensure that we are following the most updated best practices, meeting all regulations, and addressing the future needs of our students.   Our staff consistently follows current trends and in collaboration with administration, creates a plan of action to incorporate those trends that are most appropriate into the classrooms.<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students at DAV School are offered many opportunities to explore their interests and investigate new ideas.  We offer many clubs, activities, sports and a large variety of musical ventures that our students can participate in.  Many of our students are involved in a variety of extra curricular activities that allow them the opportunity to grow at their own pace in a safe, nurturing environment.  Our list of clubs, activities and other extra curricular offerings are broadened each year in hopes to have something that interests every student.<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider myself very fortunate to be a team member of DAV School. Each day I am amazed by the little things the people of our school community do for one another.  It is these daily reminders that make our school special. Please take a moment and visit our school website.  As always please feel free to contact me with any questions or concern.<br/>

 <br/>
Mr. Krishna Raj Dangol
